For as long as I can remember, I have had shame over feeling drawn towards toys and tv shows for girls. My go-to example is asking for an easy-bake oven for Christmas when I was like 3 (back then they were marketed exclusively to girls). As soon as I opened it, it somehow occurred to me that it was a girl toy, and I felt ashamed that I had asked for it, and I didn't play with it for years. A little older, I would watch TV with my brother and friends all the time, they were always at our house. And the older boy would always make a big deal about how we couldn't look at the commercials for girl toys, because it was an abomination or something (he used the word 'abomination' a lot), and I would feel ashamed because I would see those commercials for toys like Polly Pocket and My Little Pony, and I would like them. But then I would mentally beat myself up for even having thoughts like that and repress my awareness of the desire. Even when they weren't around, I was afraid of watching shows that might be 'girl shows'. I would rely on my brother. If he seemed ok with a certain show coming on and didn't feel the need to change the channel, then I would infer that it was ok for me to watch the show. And if I didn't have that assurance, then I would pretend to myself that I didn't even want to watch the show, no matter how many times I flipped through the channels pretending I was just browsing, when I was really trying to have a peek at a show without anyone thinking I wanted to watch it. (This is why I never watched Zoey 101. I did however get to watch certain ""girl"" shows either thanks to direct encouragement from my mom, like in the case of Strawbery Shortcake, or thanks to my brother not changing the channel, like in the case of W.I.T.C.H). I would say I was always repressing my own awareness of this kind of thing until maybe 2nd or 3rd grade, when I accepted that there is just something wrong (feminine) with me that I need to be aware of so I can keep it hidden. I wished I could have just been normal. While some things were obviously gendered, there were other things I didn't recognize as gendered until I was a bit older. Some not too non-conforming, like I asked my mom to let me take tap-dancing as a kid, which I later thought was maybe a bit embarrassing. Some more so, like reading Twilight in maybe 4th or 5th grade, and then being excited for the New Moon film. I certainly completely did not realize I was supposed to hate Twilight and sparkling vampires until 6th grade, and I was once again extremely embarrassed at myself, and I immediately started acting like I'd never even cared for it. I'm getting ahead of myself because I was supposed to say the exact same thing happened in, I think like 2nd or 3rd grade. I watch High School Musical over the summer and I was in love with it. I remember watching it over and over again. It was on-demand I guess. Then I show up to school, and learn that boys are not supposed to like it, just the girls. So I was forced to just repress my love of the film. I didn't watch the sequel until over a decade later because of this shame over something that was literally like my favorite movie of all time for a few weeks. And I really love musicals ok. Personally I feel like that's a mildly more feminine interest, at least I certainly felt like that for years as I got older. Like, a Disney movie would come out, and I'd avoid watching it, thinking ""Disney movies, and especially musicals, are for little kids and girls"". I was fully in that ideology when Frozen came out when I was in 9th grade. And I tried to ignore it, but I would hang out with one of my friends who was a girl while she was hanging out with some of her other friends who were girls and a gay guy, and they were talking about wanting to see Frozen, and I was just JEALOUS of them for even being able to say something like that without shame. Literally gushing about it. And I was telling myself ""No, you don't want to watch it. It's for kids and girls. It's literally a princess musical"". But of course then it came out, and for some reason I couldn't help it. I needed to watch it. But I couldn't ask my parents to take me to the theater, so while they took my little sister I watched it in my bedroom on a pirate-streaming site. And for some reason I like went into it super skeptical like ""aaarg, I'm hate-watching this. this is gonna be so stupid"". But then it just wasn't so stupid. It was to opposite of so stupid, and I cried when Elsa sang Let it Go. And when the movie ended, I watched it all again, and it was very cathartic. I still couldn't tell anyone that I liked (loved) the movie, but somehow watching it, especially with ""let it go"", I just felt like a weight came off my shoulders. I feel like that's when I stopped shaming myself for being drawn to things like that. All that was left was feeling like I had the right to express it. Which took another 4-5 years. Anyway, yeah I had other things, like in elementary school I would mimic mannerisms from people, and I had a tendency to pick up feminine mannerisms without realizing they were gendered. Like to give a particular example, I recall an experience where I was thinking about how embarrassing it is when something makes me laugh or smile against my will in public. (yeah, I had weird neuroses. very shy). And some how I started observing this one girl in my class who I always thought was cool, and I saw she would do this thing where she would cover her mouth with her hands when she laughed. And I was like, ""ah, I like that"" and I started doing that, and I literally did it for years before I realized it was feminine. There is a masculine equivalent of it, but that is not the one I was doing. And there were just a bunch of little things like that that I picked up in early childhood, and then had to unlearn in adolescence. I also cried very easily as a kid. Not just when something happened to me, but If I saw someone else crying just a bit, I would start crying too. It's probably because i'm an HSP, but I think it's worth mentioning because it is absolutely something that contributed to my sense of having something shame-fully feminine withing me, and I was definitely ashamed of it, and always tried so hard not to cry. Now when something starts to make me cry, 90% of the time I can't turn off the automatic act of trying to stop the tears from coming out, and it just makes my eyes hurt a lot. My voice sounded girly also. I remember first becoming aware of this in maybe 6th grade, watching a video I recorded with my friend, and I felt very insecure about it, and began consciously trying not to sound girly, but it only really worked sometimes. By 9th grade I realized that my vocal inflection would get girlier again when I was comfortable with my friends and in a good mood. In 9th grade I watched a video of my friends and I playing Minecraft, and I swore to god I suddenly heard a girl speaking, and I was confused because I knew there was no girl playing with us that day. And when I asked my friend who they hell that was, he said ""that's you my guy!"" I was like ""what?? I sound like a girl!!??"" and he said ""Yeah!"" as if that was obvious. I don't know why nobody told me that. Usually, people just told me I sounded white. It certainly wasn't just me sounding like a pre-pubescent boy. We were all ~13 in that video. Nobody else sounded like a girl. Anyway, after that my voice was starting to deepen, and hearing my voice do anything feminine while sounding so male made me sick, and I developed an increasingly monotone voice, especially after my friends betrayed my emotional trust and I stopped feeling so comfy around them. I remember it was 10th grade on the bus when my friend pointed out to me that my voice had become very monotone. This is getting way too long i'm sorry. I didn't really do any cross-dressing as a kid. When I was really young actually I was not opposed to boys fashion. When I was like 6 I loved getting hauls of new clothes, and I had so many because my mom loved to buy me clothed because I was always so happy to try new clothes on. Literally at that age, my idea of cool fashion was like the shiny breakaway track pants and shiny silver jackets you'd see in like late 90s boy band music videos. I did not like Jeans however, and I always needed to cut out those awful paper tags. But idk, at some point I just felt like fashion for guys was either lame or fruity. I wanted to be emo in 4th grade, but then I realized emo was gay. In middle school I just felt like all I could wear was like black hoodies, or nerdy graphic tees, and I was jealous that girls had better fashion. I wanted Uggs really bad. All the cool girls wore Uggs in 7th grade. Lowkey I still want some Uggs. But I was too scared to even wear the color orange, let alone actual girls clothing. I had like this thing were i felt the need to dress masculine enough to not seem feminine, but also I couldn't dress to masculine because I was always worried about looking like a scary black guy, and I felt like I mostly solved that by simply wearing the nerdiest possible glasses. I also just didn't really fit into my friend group of boys in middle school (carried over to highschool). Like, I know you wanna say ""oh that's autism"" but like no, it's not. That was the most neurotypical friendgroup in the whole school I bet. We had a guy diagnosed with aspergers as a child. His childhood bestfriend who exudes reddit-autist energy to this day. A guy who was into My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and Warrior Cats and then became a Nazi. A guy who to this day is obsessed with Sonic. If I am autistic, autism is not what made me stand out. What made me stand out is that they were all very comfortable jousting with eachother the way boys do. The mean jabs, and one-ups over eachother constantly, and I just didn't find that natural. If someone said something mean I would just ask them not to be mean. I didn't want to joust back at them because that felt mean! It was stuff like that, and the way I was always trying to goad them into doing more emotionally intimate things, like Spin-the-bottle-truth-or-dare. Or the way I always wanted us to be co-operative in games, while they always leaned towards competitiveness and backstabbing. (I cannot tell you how many times my house was burned down in Minecraft. And did I ever get anyone back for it? NO! I was so nice.) I was taken advantage of because of my softness. On the bright side, that also meant I was the designated diplomat of the group! (I am not being cute with my words. We conceived of our lunch table in middle school as a Nation, and the table of mostly girls behind us did the same, and we would sometimes pretend to do pseudo-political things.) When it was time to end a ""war"" with the ""Nation"" adjacent to us in the lunch room in 8th grade, I was designated a ""diplomat"" and they sent me over there for the rest of the year to make peace. And they were much nicer to me, and we talked about fun things like atheism and bisexuality. And it was the case again early in highschool when some girls from a nearby friend group were trying to get the attention of one of our guys.  

Anyway, I feel like that is quite enough","Well, this is my survey so obviously the thing I explained about "

predisposition more compatible with femininity - being sensitive, empathic, nurturing, wanting to be open and welcoming, risk-aversion, cooperation over competition

sexuality - enjoy the idea of being pursued and desired, submissive, masochistic

sense of indignation at the state of sexual antagonism in society - this is mostly in relation to feminism, that im bunched in as an oppressor, hating the burden of masculinity, that as a man im encouraged to be egoistic and seen as dangerous, experiencing womb envy

as i began to enter my teens this became more difficult, i began developing hostilities to girls after being upset by sexual advances from them. resentment slowly set in, and i hit a point where i began to preempt girls in setting boundaries between us. this naturally put a wedge between me and my friends, but come my teens i had ceased to care. a brush with bullying in early secondary school made me dimly aware of a split between what i was consciously allowing myself to feel about being submissive to males and what i actually felt, which was made more pronounced by the scorn a female teacher showed for it. this pattern of sexual desire both wanted and unwanted resulted in me becoming more misogynistic over time, as it was essentially a social requirement in order to A) get at the objects of my desire and B) avoid / avoid internalising the sexual desires of women and girls. as time went on and puberty changed me i fell more and more into personal neglect and misery, as my mother strove more and more to force masculinity onto me. my only exposure to gay culture was as something seedy and dirty, unpalatable to me. the concept of trans functionally didnt exist, save for someone vaguely referred to as ""sex change jim"". i would compensate for this by displays of social incompetence which would make me unattractive to women and at least a little wanting of bullying in the eyes of boys. by the end of my late teens i had internalised the notion that i exist as an object of sexual desire for women, and i had no conscious sexuality at all. my sexual desire was more or less completely relegated to my unconscious, where it would play out behind closed doors with a friend who my family never harboured suspicions about visiting every weekend for the whole of the weekend.

i say all this to highlight the difference between this experience and the normal experience for healthy, functioning boys. cishet boys do not have teenage experiences like this, they do not develop narratives for their lives like this, they lack the means, their points of contact with gender non-conformity being few and far between. ultimately though, i consider transition merely a cope for the constraints imposed on us by society and biology. a repositioning of ourselves within the known possible, a way of easing the burden placed on us by a world which is incapable of not hating us merely for what we are and what we desire by instinct.

in addition, the notion of being gender typical is flawed, as typical gender expression in children will almost always contain children who will turn out to be trans unless we can somehow identify them at birth. ""typical gender expression"" is merely a representation of common womens prejudices and sexual desires towards children.","by action. by desire. by lack of belonging within the cishet norm. by an inescapable need to carve the desires of others out from under my skin. there is no is, only instinctive desire."

Hyperactivity—I have ADHD and I got diagnosed very early as I had a stereotypical hyperactive, bouncing-off-walls presentation that they see more often in boys.
Liking math/science/tech: Again I think partly innate as these weren't modelled to me growing up, neither of my parents liked these things. I was always good with numbers so maybe a case of liking it because I was already good at it.
I may have had some boyish speech or typing patterns because I played a lot of online games throughout my childhood and people frequently thought I was a boy or told me I picked ""boy usernames"".

Something I suppressed was rough and tumble play, I was very interested in it but past a certain age my friends (mostly girls) didn't want to do it. I don't know why I think it was a combination of wanting physical touch and being really jealous because I saw all the boys doing it.

I hated wanting friends because they were typically feminine and I felt no connection yet actual boys never actually resonated with me or maybe they never resonated with me. I had never wanted to wear dresses or anything feminine and would always head to the boys section for clothing. My parents said it was as young as 3 years old when I had first tantrum and refused to wear girls clothing. Somehow naturally I generally just did most things that boys do. I grew up in a very welcoming family that completely accepted me for what I was. Though outside the family I was sort of an outcast lol because people had no idea what to think of me really. Basically the only outward thing that wasn't typically masculine on me was at times I still had longer hair growing up. But that is also in a family with multiple cis men with long hair and multiple cis women with short hair, so for me, hair was never really gendered. Not to mention the huge influence long haired male hippies/rockstars had on me. However, sometimes I still hated the look I had with longer hair because my face was too feminine. So funnily enough I usually preferred short hair as a child and only truely grew out my hair as adult. While I grew older, I did meet butch women and so on... but none of them exactly resonated with me well for some reason and I continued taking after men. Probably it had more to with with gender than expressions of femininity/masculinity.","I am absolutely not female, that's for sure. I never fit as a woman, not ever. Not even tomboys or butch women. So yeah obviously that isn't me. Am I a man? Well, I look like one these days. It's easiest to be who I want without getting scrutiny. But really I feel like whatever I feel like. Why is gender even needed? I want to look exactly how I wish and do exactly what I wish without caring about however things get gendered."

And in high school ended up regrowing a bit my hair but not as much and growing my nails, hanging out with girls a bit more and girls saying they were jealous of my nails made me SO happy, but didnt transition bc i didnt know it was even possible and feared another harrassment to try to be too much GNC.","To me its mainly gender constructs, roles and expectations. I wasnt allowed to express myself and was forced to be gender conforming. The expectations of men toward women seemed to me to be hateful and abusive and i couldnt stand participating in this. I didnt want to deal with it but neither did i want to enforce or participate in it, and the most i learned about feminism, the more it seemed awful to me. I think that in a world that wasnt expecting men to have abusive comportments against women and allowed me to be GNC i could not have been trans and just a feminine man, but i really did not want to be a man, to answer to these expectations and to abuse women, because i love them."

To be Transgender is about the politics and implications of a gendered society. Im Transgender because the default social structures don't fit me. It is a purposeful and chosen descriptor that anyone can adopt, and so I don't just think I am trans; I declare it and it is true by that declaration. 

To be Transexual is a medical issue. I believe that I am transexual because my nervous system and my endocrine system (as well as other related systems) do not properly function together. I was transexual before my diagnosis and medical transition. The transition is just a treatment for my debilitating and pre-existing condition of being transexual. The condition is probably a thing that one is born with but I personally didn't have any real symptoms till puberty."

I often was told I sat like a girl among other things. 

I spend a lot of time on the Barbie.com website as a child as well.",Probably some weird mirroring thing in the brain that resulted in my ability to empathize and identify with things being less rigid than most people.

I knew something was wrong, but since I had no trans education as a child I never knew what was wrong. I tried to force myself to comply to the group that I knew I SHOULD feel like (female) but as I got older and I learned more my natural side began to appear more. I liked more ""boyish"" things and felt more comfortable in ""male"" clothing or hairstyles. As a child I forced away this part of myself in hopes that it would go away, but it didn't, obviously. I also thing my AudHD played a big part of this feeling of being ostracized and not really having a place on the social gender spectrum (male/female). I learned to pretend to be normal and female but once I was in an environment where I could undo those deeply engrained habits, I did, and that's when I began to comfortably explore my gender identity.","I think some of it could be due to the AudHD and not really feeling that anywhere really suits me as I am, but other than that I don't know. I've just always felt different, and this is the kind of different that makes me happy and comfortable. Being trans has boosted my confidence and brought about a new kind of self-acceptance that has impacted my mental and physical health positively."
